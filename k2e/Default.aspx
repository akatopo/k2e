Zeitgeist adds more data providers, speeds up, will appear in GNOME-Shell and gets a dedicated MeeGo dev Some call it Zeitgeist, a few paranoid people call it Skynet. Either way Zeitgeist is one of the most exciting technologies to have arisen in the last few years. I have a tonne of Zeitgeist news to bring you up-to speed on, so enough with these pointless introductions that plague every article I write… Speed boost Asking Zeitgeist to ‘find stuff’ is now ‘multiple times faster’ after a benchmark tool revealed that, well, it wasn’t as fast as it could be. Markus Korn, who’s done the optimizations, has written much more on what’s been changed and why on his blog. Data sources New data sources have been added to the Zeitgeist PPA. Amongst these are Bazaar, Eye Of Gnome (default image viewer) Totem. Rhythmbox now ships with a Zeitgeist plugin by default. Shell Zeitgeist will be integrated into GNOME Shell. This notion was previously dismissed by GNOME developers however GNOME founder Federico Mena Quintero took to the GNOME Boston Summit to push the case for its inclusion. The Good news? It will be integrated! Congratulations  Zeitgeist team! MeeGo Zeitgeist now has a dedicated MeeGo developer whose tasked with bringing Zeitgeist fruit to bear on MeeGo trees. Get As always Zeitgeist can be installed via the official PPA. sudo add-apt-repository ppa:zeitgeist/ppa sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install

feature: Following Freeware: October 2010 new releases Written by Steve Brown — November 15, 2010   This month, you can be a travelling storyteller, a demonic servant of the devil or a girl lost in a fairytale wood. Travel back in time to the era of the plague, forward in time to a virtual reality-based future, or backwards and forwards in time trying to fix a strange disaster. Or go adventuring at a palace, revolt in a castle or take flight (sometimes briefly) in two steampunk airships. There’s even an opportunity to take on an old role as a fan-made addition to a popular commercial series gets an important update. And did I mention you can do it all for free? Broken Sword 2.5: The Return of the Templars Life has been tough recently for George Stobbart. First he was forced to leave Nico for a year, then his beloved grandfather died. Then, out of the blue, a telegram arrives telling him Nico is dead. Rushing to Paris, his joy at finding Nico alive is tempered by her strange, almost cold, reaction to his return. Sitting in the cafe where it all began, he is accosted by Andre Lobineau, who tells him a disturbing tale of Nico’s recent activities, including a brief disappearance. Could the cult of the Neo-Templars not be quite as dead as he thought? This fan-made addition to the popular series by indie developers mindfactory (with full support from Revolution) has been available for some time in German with English subtitles. This month finally saw the release of an English voice-pack, allowing players to enjoy the game fully in English for the first time. The production values of this game are on par with the original two commercial releases, with detailed graphics and a full orchestral score. Locations from the first game, such as the cafe only now reopening after the explosion that set George on his adventures, are faithfully recreated. The voicework is competently done overall, though George himself is slightly weak and has a marginally different accent to the actor of the original games. This shouldn’t be enough to put anyone off, however, as otherwise this is a game that looks like it could easily justify a commercial release. The game can be downloaded from one of the listed download mirrors and the English voice pack can be downloaded directly from the developer’s website. Technobabylon: Part 1 - The Prisoner of Fate In a dystopian future, unnamed forces seek to isolate and destroy a young woman. Unaware of this animosity, she lies on her bed, immersed in the virtual reality world of Trance, a connection between millions of individuals worldwide. When her apartment is isolated and all connection to the outside world is lost, she is thrown back to the reality of her cramped one-room apartment. With only its sparse contents and the local computer resources she can link into her virtual reality setup, she must find a way to get out. In both tone and look, Technocrat’s series debut is very reminiscent of Beneath a Steel Sky, and this game actually stands up well to that comparison. In particular, the virtual reality world – with the protagonist’s powerful-looking avatar and physical representations of programs like the security system’s knight – reminded me of Revolution’s classic. In contrast to the full-screen virtual world, the actual apartment sits cramped in the middle of the screen, taking up no more than half of the available space. This visual trick effectively explains why the young protagonist might prefer the virtual world. The contrast is further enhanced by an upbeat semi-techno tune in virtual reality against a doleful piano piece for actual reality. Puzzles involve switching between the two worlds, as actions in one world often open new options in the other. Be aware that, as the included readme states, the save system currently doesn’t work, though the game is short enough that this should not prove a problem. The game is truly a “part 1”, as a cliffhanger ending gives promise of more to come. Technobabylon: Part 1 - The Prisoner of Fate can be downloaded from the AGS website. The Trader of Stories: Bell’s Heart Myosotis is a trader of stories, a traveller who makes a living from gathering and recounting tales in the places she passes. A broken cart wheel forces her to seek help in a small village, and though a lack of funds initially make things look bleak for our traveller, the village has a story to tell. As Myosotis, can you piece together the chronicle of Derrida and the butterfly woman? Presented in a browser-based slideshow format, this game has a soft pastel look, with a folk music-style guitar tune providing a pleasant backing. The setting is a light fantasy world where magic exists but does not control all aspects of life. Navigation can be slightly confusing at times, especially in one case where you have to climb up a hill to visit a lake in the valley behind you, but the relatively small area prevents this from being a major problem. With the exception of the main quest, most puzzles are inventory-based, with conversations providing hints and direction. The narrative you seek is pieced together from dialogue, items and locations. In a nice touch, it builds up in your storybook not only as lines of text, but also beautifully illustrated panels of the tale. This is a self-contained sample of an intended larger game by Marek Rudowski and can be played online at Escape Games 24. Morbid: Chapter 2 - The Cure It is the time of the Black Plague. Death sweeps across Europe and millions die in agony. But not all the dead rest easy in their graves. Having despatched one of these creatures in the first chapter, as the unnamed protagonist you now find yourself near a monastery that offers hope of a cure. Yet as you search for the necessary ingredients, you find the nearby buildings to be virtually devoid of people. Is this all the work of the plague or was the thing you killed not alone? This game picks up where the (recently re-released) previous chapter left off, literally commencing in the same location. In keeping with the sombre nature of the story, black and white graphics with a gothic tone are the order of the day. There is the occasional splash of red, but this is reserved for the less natural inhabitants. Whilst improved with more obvious pathways than the previous instalment, the stylised graphics still make it difficult to distinguish hotspots, whether exits or objects, from the backgrounds. Other than that, the puzzles are mostly logical and generally not too taxing. The atmosphere is well-maintained with the graphic style suiting the desolation of the area, further aided by the sombre chime of item collection and other creepy sound effects. This horrorfest from Pastel Games can be played online at Armor Games. Next to Evil Duet is sister to the queen of the Worldwide Monarchy, a family dynasty that rules through their ability to use magic. Whilst Duet wields an unusual power of her own, she worries for the damage her family does to the world. So when a mysterious veiled woman offers her the chance to betray her family, she must choose between loyalty and starting a revolution. This game was made by Joel Page as part of the regular AGS competition to create a game within one month. The cartoonish graphics are somewhat on the simple side, but are generally effective, and there is a pleasant soundtrack with medieval overtones. Though not fully fleshed out in such a short game, there is sufficient detail from conversations and the musings of the player character to get a decent feel for the world. This is helped by a cameo from the protagonist of A Woman for All Seasons, Page’s entry in the recent One Room, One Week competition. Duet’s ability to split into two presents an unusual twist that affects a number of the fairly sparse puzzles. Next to Evil can be downloaded from the AGS website. Palacin If you’re an adventurer seeking a quest to make your name, the royal palace seems a good place to start. Such is the thinking of our protagonist as he arrives at the palace steps. Dubbed “Palacin” due to a misunderstanding over his desire to enter, his first problem is actually getting inside. From there, the direction of his quest may just depend on how adventurous he is. Set over five chapters and boasting four different endings, this is an ambitious first game from Mythicto. Good use of shading with light-reflecting surfaces gives a fully three-dimensional look to both the locations and the characters. This impressive presentation is slightly let down by a stiff walking animation that does not fit well with the character’s actual progress. The background music is pleasantly simple and unobtrusive. Whilst the method of getting into the palace is the same for all endings, some of the decisions you make after this determine which one you end up with. Conversations will usually point you in the right direction, though some hunting for inventory and lateral thinking is required to actually achieve your goals. Palacin can be downloaded from Mythicto's website. SW: The Mary Reed Chronicles As a member of the Algorian resistance, Mary Reed is travelling to the rebel stronghold Camp Patterson. There she hopes to rendezvous with her childhood friend and the Algorian princess, Anna. When news reaches her that the camp has been destroyed and the princess captured, she sets out on a daring rescue mission. Aided by her war robot, Rusty, can she free the captives from the forces of Demo’s evil empire? This is Hero Interactive’s first foray into point-and-click adventure, set in the steampunk world of their Stormwinds shooting defence games. The graphics are a moderately simple cartoon style, with decent animation of both characters and machinery. In keeping with the combative nature of its forebears, a certain amount of violence is depicted throughout the game. The sound is mostly limited to appropriate effects, though there is a stirring anthem at the game’s end. A couple of the puzzles require quick-clicking for success, though death simply restarts the current scene. More often you will be trying to avoid direct confrontation by distracting guards and engineering sneak approaches. There is a side quest to collect seven letters scattered throughout the game, and successfully achieving this is said to open up a “more violent and awesome” alternate ending. SW: The Mary Reed Chronicles can be played online at Armor Games. Gretel and Hansel 2 Sad Gretel and her jollier brother Hansel are lost in the woods. With a myriad of mundane and fairytale hazards all around them, their chances of ever seeing their home again look bleak. Can you find a path through these perils to the safety that lies beyond? This is a streamed sequel to Gretel and Hansel , and the same look and feel of makopudding’s earlier title carries over to this game. The graphics are hand-painted watercolour predominantly done in sepia and grey tones, with other colours limited to a handful of important items. Such a look serves as a reminder that this is undoubtedly a grim fairytale. This fact appears to be appreciated more by player character Gretel, whose dour expression is in stark contrast to Hansel’s perpetual wide-mouthed grin. Animation is smooth and includes idle gestures that culminate in Gretel falling asleep if she is left alone long enough. The ambience is completed with a string-based soundtrack that conveys an unnerving tone. Control is handled through a combination of keyboard for movement and mouse for interaction. The game has no spoken or text dialogue, as conversations and thoughts are conveyed by animated illustrations in thought and speech bubbles. Violent and unpleasant deaths abound, but an automatic save system restarts you just before death and allows you to leave and return later. Gretel and Hansel 2 can be played online at Newgrounds. Reincarnation: All Hallow’s Evil Once again, the security measures in Hell have proved inadequate. A soul named Darcy has escaped through a reincarnation portal back into the human realm. Your job as a demon despatched by Luke, a.k.a. The Devil, is to bring him back. Catch him up to his old tricks and then bring about the demise of his new body in order to put him back where he belongs. With four full games and five mini-games in two years, this broswer-based series by B Group Productions is impressively lengthy. Links for all the previous Reincarnation games appear on the title screen, though each is self-contained. The cartoon graphics are crisp and clear with expressive characters. The animations are equally well done, especially the demon himself, who not only looks evil but manages to move evilly as well. This presentation is rounded off with a sinister soundtrack and impressive voicework for all characters, including Luke giving instructions at the start. Being a demon, a wave of your fingers is enough to supernaturally influence small objects, even at a distance. You will also sometimes need to use these eldritch powers to distract others so you can complete your work secretly. This is a black comedy and player discretion is advised, as the crimes of the soul and method of despatch are both somewhat unpleasant. Reincarnation: All Hallow’s Evil can be played online at the developer’s website. Gearlock: Episode 1 Tasked with transporting an important prisoner, the airship under your command comes under attack. While fending off your aerial attackers, you are struck by a missile that brings you down in a remote forest. With half of your crew dead and major damage to your systems, you need to improvise repairs to get aloft again. Preferably before whoever fired that missile comes looking for you. This is another game with a steampunk setting, this time from Hyptosis. The game is presented in a slideshow format and mostly set on your airship, full of pipes and tubes with the occasional electrical system sandwiched in between, all done in a light anime style. After a brief and very simple shooting game at the start, play continues on in a traditional point-and-click fashion. Two rousing tunes alternate to form the soundtrack, punctuated by occasional sound effects. As well as resetting various parts of the machinery on your ship, you’ll have to search for parts to fix broken systems. Gearlock: Episode 1 can be played online at Newgrounds. Lightning Master An ordinary man is settling down to watch his favourite 1960s TV show, The Prisoner. When the power cuts out and his car goes missing, he walks into town, only to find a strange situation. The whole town is empty, and all cars and people have vanished without a trace, a situation that mirrors the plot of the episode he was watching. He soon discovers a machine that can apparently transport him through time, and a notebook that rewrites itself when he does so. He has been chosen to put right what has gone wrong. Can he unravel the mystery and put the world back as it should be? This is the first game from Creative Loops and is a hefty 152MB download. Clearly a lot of this has gone into the graphics, which are detailed photo composites with a handful of hand-drawn elements. The composites are neatly done, with no obviously jarring edges where elements meet. Apart from the television theme song played at the start, sound is limited to effects only, with no other musical score. This does emphasise the emptiness of the town, but I missed having any noise at all after a while. Initially you will wander around aimlessly, but discovering the notebook and time machine will start giving you clues to direct your investigation. Lightning Master can be downloaded from the AGS website. Other new releases Not all games are created equal, and freeware games especially come in all shapes and sizes. Not to be overlooked, the following list might also be of interest, though these games may be significantly shorter or less polished, more experimental titles than those detailed above, some perhaps only borderline adventures to begin with. One Room by Wyz – Have a surreal experience in this updated version of a literal-minded “One Room, One Week” entry. Hello Neighbour! by Sayhello-hello – Bring friendship, love and lasting animosity to a group of six apartment-dwellers. Oceanspirit Dennis: The Naked and the Ninja by Poncho – When Oceanspirit Dennis is kidnapped, it’s up to Life Partner Ray to save the day in this adult comedy. The Outbreak by SilkTricky - Expect to die a lot in this choose-your-path live-action zombie film. Underworld Army: Episode 1 by prasannakkcse - Infiltrate Professor Pain's secret underground laboratory and disable his robotic army. That’s it for this month. Think we’ve missed a gem or want to tell us about your own game? Then pop in to our Freeware Adventure forum and tell us about it!

Lucky Hit Stand - When you first get to Kowloon you will be on Dragon St. in this area is a Lucky Hit Stand called Challenge, which is fairly hard to find, keep to the right and you'll find a path leading around past some derelict house and up the stairs. What you have to do is bet $5 to play the first game then win that and play the 2nd game, then win that and play the final 3rd game. If at any point you hit an X you will have to start again from game 1. Once you have won the first Move Scroll you can play again for another one they are in order: HEEL SWEEP MONKEY ROLL DROP

2. Bubble Bobble Item generation mechanism, vast assortment of items, Bubble Alphabet, game modes and codes, and ending conditions Published & developed by Taito Designed by Fukio Mitsuji Reason for inclusion: How could this one not be included? Possibly the most mysterious game ever produced for arcades, with the only likely exception being its sequel, Rainbow Islands. Lots of stuff about this game was only fully understood when someone finally disassembled the code a few years back. The game: Bubble Bobble’s multiple layers of secret knowledge make it a game for wizards. A huge array of arcane trivia must be learned to exploit Bubble Bobble’s many systems. Some of it is only now becoming commonly known. First thing to know is that the arcade game has secret codes. That was almost unheard of at the time — yet Bubble Bobble not only has them, it will tell the player about them in the right circumstances, and using one is required to see the game’s real ending. The circumstances in question, however, are nearly obscene: a game must be played to level 20, 30 or 50 without dying in order to see one, and death is rather common in Bubble Bobble after the first few levels. Once on the proper level, the bonus item normally generated in the level will instead be a door to a secret room, containing huge score bonuses and the code printed on the background… but the code, itself, is written in code. At first it just looks like background decoration of runic glyphs, but it’s really a secret message from the developers. The secret is spilled on the ending screen, where the player is informed “But it was not a true end!” and the specialness of the glyphs is revealed. That is, if he won in two-player mode. Winning with only a single player in the game sends him back to a random level. D’oh! One of the secret codes makes the doors that lead to the bonus levels appear regardless of lives lost, which is nice to know once the player’s already figured out the code, I guess. Another code, when entered from the title screen in the machine’s attract mode, puts the game into “Super” mode, which mixes up the enemies in the levels and is somewhat more difficult. But it is only in Super mode that the game can truly be won, by working through all 100 levels again and finishing up in two-player mode. (And without dying, incidentally, but fortunately most people who win actually play as one player through most of the game, only putting player two in after the last boss has been beaten, and having just joined he won’t have ever died.) This is far from the only mysterious thing about the game. Probably the most mysterious is the formula that determines when special items appear. Most players believe it to be random, but actually they’re all directly determined by the player’s actions. The game maintains counts of a large array of trivia, like bubbles popped, times jumped, water bubbles burst, and times wrapped around the screen. When a counter exceeds a threshold value, a flag is set scheduling the item to be generated in an upcoming level. The counts and flags are not reset when a game is finished, which is why new players often get treated to advanced items in the very first levels. But it also means if someone knows that, say, popping water bubbles makes level-skipping umbrellas appear more often, he can take advantage of that fact to skip ahead more often. Some of the tricks that make items appear cannot be done on every level, so it also tends to cause certain items to “clump,” generating more often on particular boards. It’s nearly a textbook example of chaotic behavior in game design. The player’s many varied actions lead, through unknown processes, to results that you’d assume are random, but seem to have some mysterious consistency to them. It is an interesting way to bring players into a game: to pin success on objects that appear almost on command, but without telling exactly what that command is. Design lesson: Pseudo-random numbers are used by many games, but Bubble Bobble, while apparently random, in fact contains few of them. Once their principles are understood they can be gamed, but they are not explained to the player. The result is that different play styles produce consistent variation in the game’s response to them, which can provoke responses from players so complex that they border on superstition.

View original hardydev.com Visually Directing the Player » A Hardy Developer's Journal – of independent adventure games and snakes Visually Directing the Player » A Hardy Developer’s Journal – of independent adventure games and snakes There are fewer things more enlightening about what is really wrong with a game than play-testing, and if you’re lucky, physical play-testing with a real, breathing person. The creator of a game always views things in a certain lens that skews the true perception of what’s going on, what’s needed, and what’s really visible to the player. For instance, in some of the play-tests I’ve had, I would run into a recurrent problem about the player’s visual direction–I want the player to go a certain way, open a certain door, or go down a certain ramp–but what’s the obvious direction for me is not the obvious direction for the player. This doesn’t mean that the player is mentally impaired or ‘bad at video games.’ On the contrary, one philosophy that I try to abide by in game-design is that there are no bad players–only bad designers. If a player feels stupid, cheated, or frustrated, it shouldn’t be the player’s fault. It should be the designer’s responsibility to prevent the player from feeling this way, and to do this, there exists the much beloved activity of play-testing. There are many problems that arise out of a good play-test, but I’m going to focus on the aforementioned one of “visual direction,” to guide the player a specific way. First, what is “visual direction?” I would define it as using visual elements on screen as to give the player a specific direction to reinforce their gameplay goals. For example, a giant arrow pointing down a hallway telling the player to go this way, not that way. Why do we need visual direction in games? Sure, there’s some fun in being thrown into a non-linear situation, with no direction or hint as to which way to proceed, but oftentimes the player needs a reinforcement of her goals, a reminder of what she should be doing. If I’m presented with a choice of three random doors, one of which continues on the correct path, the other two on the wrong path to my never-ending doom, I don’t want to recurrently guess which way to go and end up spending half my time going the wrong way only to turn around and try to find the correct path again. By using visual direction (a cue hinting the player which way to go) to restrict non-linearity, you decrease the amount of time that a player is lost and confused, and increase the amount of time that the player pursues her goals, arguably creating a more enjoyable experience for her. Why use visual direction instead of directly telling the player what to do? So you may ask, why not just out-right state to the player “Go to this screen. Open this door. Exit this hallway.” The answer is because you want the player to feel like she has solved something, that she was the one who discovered the solution, not was told it. It’s the same principle in any Zelda game when you realize that the little eye on the monster’s back is glowing and that is the key to defeating him. You weren’t told directly that this was the solution, but you inferred it by the game’s visual direction. In some scenes in Boryokudan Rue (minor spoilers below), my current project, I wanted the player to do many things: interact with a cord on the ground, exit a screen to the right, go down a ramp to an adjacent room, etc. But many times the player would totally miss these items on the screen and be lost for several minutes before even realizing those elements existed. To solve these problems, I proposed the following solutions: 1) Lighting Cues The first visual feature I adapted to help guide the player is lighting. Nothing is more visually confusing than a monotonous wash of colors that blend into each other. With this, the player cannot tell what is going on, what is where, or what he has to do. One easy way to direct the player’s eyes to a certain spot is by using lighting cues to contrast with the rest of the background. In this screen from Boryokudan Rue I had several goals. First, I wanted to develop the player’s sense of a journey by making visible the city in the distance, a location which they had visited earlier. Second, I wanted to create the feeling that they were on a vista, looking back at what they had done so far. Third, I wished to present their next location, an abandoned ‘warehouse’ (spoiler alert!), which is on the right. However, as it stands above, the screen could still be improved by directing the player more efficiently. Originally the only light source was the lamp on the left, which highlighted the player’s entrance. However, the direction as to where to go from here is slightly ambiguous because the rest of the background is somewhat monotonous in color and value (although there is only one visible exit). To help accentuate the player’s direction, I added a spotlight over the door. This contrasted this part of the image with its dark surroundings, directing the player to go to the door rather than anywhere else. This prevents the player from wandering around unnecessarily and gets them back into the game quicker. Here, lighting is used to guide the player back to his goals. 2) Hotspots The second feature, although obvious (and being text), is a hotspot indicator. This involves directly stating to the player that yes, this is an element of the background you will need to interact with, and yes it is there. Many games use this feature to indicate exits on a screen with an arrow of some sorts, but in my case I just added a label. This screen was created to illustrate the city life of New Pittsburg in Boryokudan Rue. I made the major sources of light indicative of the main elements in the background: the shopkeeper’s hut, the red door, and the red light diffusing from the back (I also have the windows lighted up, which in retrospect, I’m not sure is a good idea since it attracts attention away from everything else). However, this screen had the problem of unidentifiable exits, one of which was harder to spot than the others. Some players did not realize that you could walk behind the shopkeeper into an alley in order to gain access to an additional area. Since I already added a secondary red light source coming from the alley, I created an additional hotspot, “Back Alley” on top of it to tell the players that they could go down this way. This directly tells the players that the alley was a feature of the game by giving them feedback every time they moved the mouse over the alley. This use of a hotspot helped solved the problem of the player missing the exit. 3) Animation Sometimes using both lighting and hotspots isn’t enough for a player to figure out that he needs to interact with something. In this case, a third useful element is animation. This could involve flickering a light on or off, rain dripping out of a leak, or dust particles floating in the air. The attraction of motion draws attention to itself and thus the objects contained in or near the motion. The following screen is in a dark and moody room, which I utilized to create fewer, more important swabs of light. These important swabs of light would direct the player’s attention to the only parts of the screen that mattered, the parts that contained the puzzles. However, even with direct sources of light, some players still needed additional direction. In this spot I wanted players to pick up a cord on the ground in order to solve a puzzle. However, even with the additional lighting it would still be missed. What I then did was create a particle animation that recycled in the light, drawing further attention to that area. This was just a simple animation of dust pixels falling, but it stood out from the rest of the screen because it is dynamic in contrast to the static background, drawing the player’s attention to it. This animation was just one more step to help the player concentrate on the puzzle, rather than spending time looking for it instead. 4) Contextual Trails The last item to guide the player visually is something I will call for sake of convenience “contextual trails.” You see, there was this one ramp–it was a very evil ramp–and no matter what I did, the player would always miss it. I added a spot light onto it; I created a hotspot for it; I didn’t add animation for it; but I did solve the problem of the player missing it by using the very fancy term: contextual trails, or put more simply, a meandering trail of blood. This last image illustrates that small ramp which players needed to access to continue, but due to its somewhat tangential location on the screen, players would continually miss it. I tried lighting, hotspots, and all that good stuff, but I eventually realized there was a much simpler solution. My solution–was blood. When all else fails, blood can solve any problem. Add blood to a scene, lead it down a path, and the player will be helpless but to follow it. And it doesn’t have to be blood either–it can be footsteps, water, or anything that leaves a trail. Blood just happens to come with the added narrative weight of tension (you are in danger!), conflict (somebody killed him!), and history (there was a past here!), which easily enhances the atmosphere. Visually indicating that someone else in the game has already walked this path is probably the most surefire way to move the player without directly telling them to do so. — Visual indicators are a great way of leading the player to his or her goals without directly telling them to do so. However, there are many other things you can do visually that also communicate to the player, but in a different way. You can shake the screen to increase tension, telling the player to hurry up on his or her merry way; you can flash the screen red to indicate that they are pressed for time; you can animate lights failing to indicate the worn-down condition of the environment; so much can be done visually in games to communicate to the player and enhance the atmosphere that cannot be done with text. I’m sure there are many more ideas that are out there and I’d love to hear and discuss them. It’s important to utilize every aspect, visual or otherwise, to continually  communicate with the player.

Because the tactile sensations from the controllers feed into the way the game plays and the way people experience it, it’s all a sort of holistic product design. I think parts of Microsoft have caught onto that a little bit, and the reason I think that is the Xbox 360 controller has become the de facto standard for PC development — if you’re going to make a game on PC that uses the controller. And it’s because it feels so good, you know, it has a wonderful tactile sensation; the only thing that sucks about it is the D-pad. Everything else about it is like the best standard controller that’s ever been made. I don’t think a lot of people would disagree with that, because what are the other contenders? There aren’t any. It’s really easy to understand why the Microsoft 360 controller is like really, really good. The springs feel really good, the surface of it is almost like smooth human skin; it’s sort of creepy if you think about it.

It’s sort of fundamentally opposite to the idea that a game should take a certain number of hours to finish, and its inherent value to the consumer is based on how many hours it takes to finish, as opposed to the quality of those hours.

Some good starting points are ‘About Face 3: The Essentials of Interaction Design’ by Alan Cooper, ‘Designing Interfaces’ by Jenifer Tidwell and also the pttrns mobile app design pattern showcase. Approach the design from different perspectives; to learn more about the mechanics of using use cases to take a user journey centric approach I recommend the excellent ‘Writing Effective Use Cases’ book by Alistar Cockburn. And keep looking at the design through the eyes of the personas you are targeting, otherwise you may end up designing the product just for yourself!

Players are able to choose to experience distinct narrative sections, many of which are optional, without the hassle of fighting enemies to get there. Enemy levels are set according to the critical path, guiding players along it without overtly forcing them through it. Each enemy encounter is visible and avoidable, giving players control over when to fight and when to avoid confrontations. Once they have completed the game, players can use the New Game+ feature to circumvent and deconstruct the critical path that they followed on the first playthrough.

YaBASIC (Sony’s PS2) Yet Another BASIC was available for Unix, and was officially ported by Sony to the PS2, coming bundled on one of the original demo discs. Marc-Oliver Ihm tells his story: “Some years ago I received an email from a Sony official, asking if they could bundle my YaBASIC with their device. I was pleased and said yes. Some weeks later I received a PS2 for free by mail. That’s it. Sony also added some features for using graphics. As far as I know, the real reason was to save taxes within Europe. If they bundled the PS2 with a programming language, they could declare it as a computer, instead of consumer electronics. That made a difference in the amount of duty they had to pay when shipping to Europe.”

They’re optimized for audio playback, and a few buttons make that experience better. Apple tried going button-less with the iPod Shuffle in 2009 and it was a failed experiment.
