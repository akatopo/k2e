Lucky Hit Stand - When you first get to Kowloon you will be on Dragon St. in this area is a Lucky Hit Stand called Challenge, which is fairly hard to find, keep to the right and you'll find a path leading around past some derelict house and up the stairs. What you have to do is bet $5 to play the first game then win that and play the 2nd game, then win that and play the final 3rd game. If at any point you hit an X you will have to start again from game 1. Once you have won the first Move Scroll you can play again for another one they are in order: HEEL SWEEP MONKEY ROLL DROP

2. Bubble Bobble Item generation mechanism, vast assortment of items, Bubble Alphabet, game modes and codes, and ending conditions Published & developed by Taito Designed by Fukio Mitsuji Reason for inclusion: How could this one not be included? Possibly the most mysterious game ever produced for arcades, with the only likely exception being its sequel, Rainbow Islands. Lots of stuff about this game was only fully understood when someone finally disassembled the code a few years back. The game: Bubble Bobble’s multiple layers of secret knowledge make it a game for wizards. A huge array of arcane trivia must be learned to exploit Bubble Bobble’s many systems. Some of it is only now becoming commonly known. First thing to know is that the arcade game has secret codes. That was almost unheard of at the time — yet Bubble Bobble not only has them, it will tell the player about them in the right circumstances, and using one is required to see the game’s real ending. The circumstances in question, however, are nearly obscene: a game must be played to level 20, 30 or 50 without dying in order to see one, and death is rather common in Bubble Bobble after the first few levels. Once on the proper level, the bonus item normally generated in the level will instead be a door to a secret room, containing huge score bonuses and the code printed on the background… but the code, itself, is written in code. At first it just looks like background decoration of runic glyphs, but it’s really a secret message from the developers. The secret is spilled on the ending screen, where the player is informed “But it was not a true end!” and the specialness of the glyphs is revealed. That is, if he won in two-player mode. Winning with only a single player in the game sends him back to a random level. D’oh! One of the secret codes makes the doors that lead to the bonus levels appear regardless of lives lost, which is nice to know once the player’s already figured out the code, I guess. Another code, when entered from the title screen in the machine’s attract mode, puts the game into “Super” mode, which mixes up the enemies in the levels and is somewhat more difficult. But it is only in Super mode that the game can truly be won, by working through all 100 levels again and finishing up in two-player mode. (And without dying, incidentally, but fortunately most people who win actually play as one player through most of the game, only putting player two in after the last boss has been beaten, and having just joined he won’t have ever died.) This is far from the only mysterious thing about the game. Probably the most mysterious is the formula that determines when special items appear. Most players believe it to be random, but actually they’re all directly determined by the player’s actions. The game maintains counts of a large array of trivia, like bubbles popped, times jumped, water bubbles burst, and times wrapped around the screen. When a counter exceeds a threshold value, a flag is set scheduling the item to be generated in an upcoming level. The counts and flags are not reset when a game is finished, which is why new players often get treated to advanced items in the very first levels. But it also means if someone knows that, say, popping water bubbles makes level-skipping umbrellas appear more often, he can take advantage of that fact to skip ahead more often. Some of the tricks that make items appear cannot be done on every level, so it also tends to cause certain items to “clump,” generating more often on particular boards. It’s nearly a textbook example of chaotic behavior in game design. The player’s many varied actions lead, through unknown processes, to results that you’d assume are random, but seem to have some mysterious consistency to them. It is an interesting way to bring players into a game: to pin success on objects that appear almost on command, but without telling exactly what that command is. Design lesson: Pseudo-random numbers are used by many games, but Bubble Bobble, while apparently random, in fact contains few of them. Once their principles are understood they can be gamed, but they are not explained to the player. The result is that different play styles produce consistent variation in the game’s response to them, which can provoke responses from players so complex that they border on superstition. Links: The Bubble Bobble mechanics discovered through source code examination are explicated at the Bubble Bobble Info Pages.

View original hardydev.com Visually Directing the Player » A Hardy Developer's Journal – of independent adventure games and snakes Visually Directing the Player » A Hardy Developer’s Journal – of independent adventure games and snakes There are fewer things more enlightening about what is really wrong with a game than play-testing, and if you’re lucky, physical play-testing with a real, breathing person. The creator of a game always views things in a certain lens that skews the true perception of what’s going on, what’s needed, and what’s really visible to the player. For instance, in some of the play-tests I’ve had, I would run into a recurrent problem about the player’s visual direction–I want the player to go a certain way, open a certain door, or go down a certain ramp–but what’s the obvious direction for me is not the obvious direction for the player. This doesn’t mean that the player is mentally impaired or ‘bad at video games.’ On the contrary, one philosophy that I try to abide by in game-design is that there are no bad players–only bad designers. If a player feels stupid, cheated, or frustrated, it shouldn’t be the player’s fault. It should be the designer’s responsibility to prevent the player from feeling this way, and to do this, there exists the much beloved activity of play-testing. There are many problems that arise out of a good play-test, but I’m going to focus on the aforementioned one of “visual direction,” to guide the player a specific way. First, what is “visual direction?” I would define it as using visual elements on screen as to give the player a specific direction to reinforce their gameplay goals. For example, a giant arrow pointing down a hallway telling the player to go this way, not that way. Why do we need visual direction in games? Sure, there’s some fun in being thrown into a non-linear situation, with no direction or hint as to which way to proceed, but oftentimes the player needs a reinforcement of her goals, a reminder of what she should be doing. If I’m presented with a choice of three random doors, one of which continues on the correct path, the other two on the wrong path to my never-ending doom, I don’t want to recurrently guess which way to go and end up spending half my time going the wrong way only to turn around and try to find the correct path again. By using visual direction (a cue hinting the player which way to go) to restrict non-linearity, you decrease the amount of time that a player is lost and confused, and increase the amount of time that the player pursues her goals, arguably creating a more enjoyable experience for her. Why use visual direction instead of directly telling the player what to do? So you may ask, why not just out-right state to the player “Go to this screen. Open this door. Exit this hallway.” The answer is because you want the player to feel like she has solved something, that she was the one who discovered the solution, not was told it. It’s the same principle in any Zelda game when you realize that the little eye on the monster’s back is glowing and that is the key to defeating him. You weren’t told directly that this was the solution, but you inferred it by the game’s visual direction. In some scenes in Boryokudan Rue (minor spoilers below), my current project, I wanted the player to do many things: interact with a cord on the ground, exit a screen to the right, go down a ramp to an adjacent room, etc. But many times the player would totally miss these items on the screen and be lost for several minutes before even realizing those elements existed. To solve these problems, I proposed the following solutions: 1) Lighting Cues The first visual feature I adapted to help guide the player is lighting. Nothing is more visually confusing than a monotonous wash of colors that blend into each other. With this, the player cannot tell what is going on, what is where, or what he has to do. One easy way to direct the player’s eyes to a certain spot is by using lighting cues to contrast with the rest of the background. In this screen from Boryokudan Rue I had several goals. First, I wanted to develop the player’s sense of a journey by making visible the city in the distance, a location which they had visited earlier. Second, I wanted to create the feeling that they were on a vista, looking back at what they had done so far. Third, I wished to present their next location, an abandoned ‘warehouse’ (spoiler alert!), which is on the right. However, as it stands above, the screen could still be improved by directing the player more efficiently. Originally the only light source was the lamp on the left, which highlighted the player’s entrance. However, the direction as to where to go from here is slightly ambiguous because the rest of the background is somewhat monotonous in color and value (although there is only one visible exit). To help accentuate the player’s direction, I added a spotlight over the door. This contrasted this part of the image with its dark surroundings, directing the player to go to the door rather than anywhere else. This prevents the player from wandering around unnecessarily and gets them back into the game quicker. Here, lighting is used to guide the player back to his goals. 2) Hotspots The second feature, although obvious (and being text), is a hotspot indicator. This involves directly stating to the player that yes, this is an element of the background you will need to interact with, and yes it is there. Many games use this feature to indicate exits on a screen with an arrow of some sorts, but in my case I just added a label. This screen was created to illustrate the city life of New Pittsburg in Boryokudan Rue. I made the major sources of light indicative of the main elements in the background: the shopkeeper’s hut, the red door, and the red light diffusing from the back (I also have the windows lighted up, which in retrospect, I’m not sure is a good idea since it attracts attention away from everything else). However, this screen had the problem of unidentifiable exits, one of which was harder to spot than the others. Some players did not realize that you could walk behind the shopkeeper into an alley in order to gain access to an additional area. Since I already added a secondary red light source coming from the alley, I created an additional hotspot, “Back Alley” on top of it to tell the players that they could go down this way. This directly tells the players that the alley was a feature of the game by giving them feedback every time they moved the mouse over the alley. This use of a hotspot helped solved the problem of the player missing the exit. 3) Animation Sometimes using both lighting and hotspots isn’t enough for a player to figure out that he needs to interact with something. In this case, a third useful element is animation. This could involve flickering a light on or off, rain dripping out of a leak, or dust particles floating in the air. The attraction of motion draws attention to itself and thus the objects contained in or near the motion. The following screen is in a dark and moody room, which I utilized to create fewer, more important swabs of light. These important swabs of light would direct the player’s attention to the only parts of the screen that mattered, the parts that contained the puzzles. However, even with direct sources of light, some players still needed additional direction. In this spot I wanted players to pick up a cord on the ground in order to solve a puzzle. However, even with the additional lighting it would still be missed. What I then did was create a particle animation that recycled in the light, drawing further attention to that area. This was just a simple animation of dust pixels falling, but it stood out from the rest of the screen because it is dynamic in contrast to the static background, drawing the player’s attention to it. This animation was just one more step to help the player concentrate on the puzzle, rather than spending time looking for it instead. 4) Contextual Trails The last item to guide the player visually is something I will call for sake of convenience “contextual trails.” You see, there was this one ramp–it was a very evil ramp–and no matter what I did, the player would always miss it. I added a spot light onto it; I created a hotspot for it; I didn’t add animation for it; but I did solve the problem of the player missing it by using the very fancy term: contextual trails, or put more simply, a meandering trail of blood. This last image illustrates that small ramp which players needed to access to continue, but due to its somewhat tangential location on the screen, players would continually miss it. I tried lighting, hotspots, and all that good stuff, but I eventually realized there was a much simpler solution. My solution–was blood. When all else fails, blood can solve any problem. Add blood to a scene, lead it down a path, and the player will be helpless but to follow it. And it doesn’t have to be blood either–it can be footsteps, water, or anything that leaves a trail. Blood just happens to come with the added narrative weight of tension (you are in danger!), conflict (somebody killed him!), and history (there was a past here!), which easily enhances the atmosphere. Visually indicating that someone else in the game has already walked this path is probably the most surefire way to move the player without directly telling them to do so. — Visual indicators are a great way of leading the player to his or her goals without directly telling them to do so. However, there are many other things you can do visually that also communicate to the player, but in a different way. You can shake the screen to increase tension, telling the player to hurry up on his or her merry way; you can flash the screen red to indicate that they are pressed for time; you can animate lights failing to indicate the worn-down condition of the environment; so much can be done visually in games to communicate to the player and enhance the atmosphere that cannot be done with text. I’m sure there are many more ideas that are out there and I’d love to hear and discuss them. It’s important to utilize every aspect, visual or otherwise, to continually  communicate with the player.

Because the tactile sensations from the controllers feed into the way the game plays and the way people experience it, it’s all a sort of holistic product design. I think parts of Microsoft have caught onto that a little bit, and the reason I think that is the Xbox 360 controller has become the de facto standard for PC development — if you’re going to make a game on PC that uses the controller. And it’s because it feels so good, you know, it has a wonderful tactile sensation; the only thing that sucks about it is the D-pad. Everything else about it is like the best standard controller that’s ever been made. I don’t think a lot of people would disagree with that, because what are the other contenders? There aren’t any. It’s really easy to understand why the Microsoft 360 controller is like really, really good. The springs feel really good, the surface of it is almost like smooth human skin; it’s sort of creepy if you think about it.

It’s sort of fundamentally opposite to the idea that a game should take a certain number of hours to finish, and its inherent value to the consumer is based on how many hours it takes to finish, as opposed to the quality of those hours.

Some good starting points are ‘About Face 3: The Essentials of Interaction Design’ by Alan Cooper, ‘Designing Interfaces’ by Jenifer Tidwell and also the pttrns mobile app design pattern showcase. Approach the design from different perspectives; to learn more about the mechanics of using use cases to take a user journey centric approach I recommend the excellent ‘Writing Effective Use Cases’ book by Alistar Cockburn. And keep looking at the design through the eyes of the personas you are targeting, otherwise you may end up designing the product just for yourself!

Players are able to choose to experience distinct narrative sections, many of which are optional, without the hassle of fighting enemies to get there. Enemy levels are set according to the critical path, guiding players along it without overtly forcing them through it. Each enemy encounter is visible and avoidable, giving players control over when to fight and when to avoid confrontations. Once they have completed the game, players can use the New Game+ feature to circumvent and deconstruct the critical path that they followed on the first playthrough.

Things must be negative but not too negative. Hopelessness, despair—these drive us to do nothing. Pity, empathy—those drive us to do something, like get up from our computers to act. But anger, fear, excitement, or laughter—these drive us to spread.

This was, as Rob Walker wrote for The Atlantic in an analysis of the event, a core principle of our new viral culture: “Humiliation should not be suppressed. It should be monetized.”

YaBASIC (Sony’s PS2) Yet Another BASIC was available for Unix, and was officially ported by Sony to the PS2, coming bundled on one of the original demo discs. Marc-Oliver Ihm tells his story: “Some years ago I received an email from a Sony official, asking if they could bundle my YaBASIC with their device. I was pleased and said yes. Some weeks later I received a PS2 for free by mail. That’s it. Sony also added some features for using graphics. As far as I know, the real reason was to save taxes within Europe. If they bundled the PS2 with a programming language, they could declare it as a computer, instead of consumer electronics. That made a difference in the amount of duty they had to pay when shipping to Europe.”

E-ink Kindles are the anti-iPad. Single-purpose vs. all-purpose. To remain relevant in an iPad (and Kindle Fire) world, a single-purpose device like the Kindle Paperwhite needs an obsessive focus on the reading experience. Page-turning buttons would make that experience better. That’s why iPods have dedicated hardware buttons for volume and play/pause. They’re optimized for audio playback, and a few buttons make that experience better. Apple tried going button-less with the iPod Shuffle in 2009 and it was a failed experiment. The buttoned version returned a year later.
